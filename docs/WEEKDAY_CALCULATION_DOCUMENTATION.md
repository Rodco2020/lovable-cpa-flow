# Weekday Calculation Logic Documentation

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive documentation for the enhanced weekday calculation logic implemented in the CPA Practice Management Software's forecasting system. The enhancement provides accurate demand calculations for weekly recurring tasks based on specific weekdays rather than using a fixed 4.33 weeks/month approximation.

## Core Enhancement

### Problem Addressed

The previous implementation incorrectly calculated weekly recurring tasks using a fixed formula (4.33 / interval) that ignored selected weekdays. This resulted in underestimated demand calculations for tasks occurring on multiple days per week.

**Example of the Problem:**
- Task: 8 hours, Weekly, Monday/Wednesday/Friday (3 days per week)
- Old Calculation: 8 × (4.33 ÷ 1) = 34.64 hours/month ❌
- Correct Calculation: 8 × 3 × (4.35 ÷ 1) = 104.4 hours/month ✅

### Solution Implemented

The enhanced system calculates weekly recurring tasks using weekday-specific logic:

**Formula:** `estimatedHours × numberOfWeekdays × (30.44 days/month ÷ 7 days/week) ÷ recurrenceInterval`

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- Average days per month: 30.44 (accounts for leap years: 365.25 ÷ 12)
- Average weeks per month: 4.35 (30.44 ÷ 7)
- This provides more accurate monthly occurrence estimates

## Implementation Details

### Key Components

#### 1. WeekdayUtils (`src/services/forecasting/demand/recurrenceCalculator/weekdayUtils.ts`)

**Purpose:** Provides weekday validation and calculation utilities.

**Key Methods:**
- `validateAndNormalizeWeekdays()`: Validates weekday arrays and removes duplicates
- `calculateWeeklyOccurrences()`: Core calculation method for weekday-based occurrences
- `getWeekdaysDescription()`: Human-readable weekday descriptions

**Validation Logic:**
- Weekday values must be integers 0-6 (0=Sunday, 6=Saturday)
- Duplicates are automatically removed with warnings
- Invalid values are filtered out with error reporting
- Empty results after filtering are flagged as invalid

#### 2. RecurrenceTypeCalculator (`src/services/forecasting/demand/recurrenceCalculator/recurrenceTypes.ts`)

**Purpose:** Routes different recurrence types to appropriate calculation methods.

**Enhanced Weekly Logic:**
- Weekly tasks with weekdays: Uses WeekdayUtils for precise calculation
- Weekly tasks without weekdays: Falls back to legacy 4.33 calculation
- Non-weekly tasks: Uses existing type-specific calculators

#### 3. SkillCalculatorCore (`src/services/forecasting/demand/skillCalculator/skillCalculatorCore.ts`)

**Purpose:** Main calculation engine with enhanced weekday processing integration.

**Enhancements:**
- Tracks weekly tasks with weekday specifications
- Provides detailed logging for weekday calculations
- Maintains performance monitoring for large datasets

## Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Weekly Task with Multiple Weekdays

**Task Configuration:**
- Estimated Hours: 5
- Recurrence: Weekly (every 1 week)
- Weekdays: [1, 3, 5] (Monday, Wednesday, Friday)

**Calculation:**
```
Monthly Occurrences = 3 weekdays × 4.35 weeks/month ÷ 1 interval = 13.05
Monthly Hours = 5 hours × 13.05 occurrences = 65.25 hours/month
```

### Example 2: Bi-Weekly Task with Two Weekdays

**Task Configuration:**
- Estimated Hours: 8
- Recurrence: Weekly (every 2 weeks)
- Weekdays: [2, 4] (Tuesday, Thursday)

**Calculation:**
```
Monthly Occurrences = 2 weekdays × 4.35 weeks/month ÷ 2 interval = 4.35
Monthly Hours = 8 hours × 4.35 occurrences = 34.8 hours/month
```

### Example 3: Legacy Weekly Task (Backward Compatibility)

**Task Configuration:**
- Estimated Hours: 12
- Recurrence: Weekly (every 1 week)
- Weekdays: null (not specified)

**Calculation:**
```
Monthly Occurrences = 4.33 weeks/month ÷ 1 interval = 4.33 (legacy formula)
Monthly Hours = 12 hours × 4.33 occurrences = 51.96 hours/month
```

## Error Handling and Validation

### Validation Rules

1. **Weekday Value Validation:**
   - Must be integers between 0-6
   - Invalid values are filtered out with error logging
   - Non-numeric values are rejected

2. **Duplicate Handling:**
   - Duplicates are automatically removed
   - Warnings are logged for monitoring purposes

3. **Empty Array Handling:**
   - Empty weekday arrays trigger fallback to legacy calculation
   - Appropriate warnings are logged

### Fallback Mechanisms

1. **Invalid Weekdays:** Falls back to legacy 4.33 calculation
2. **Calculation Errors:** Returns zero demand to prevent system crashes
3. **Null Tasks:** Gracefully handles null/undefined tasks

## Integration Points

### Matrix Visualization

The enhanced calculations integrate seamlessly with the demand matrix visualization:

- **Accurate Cell Values:** Matrix cells display correct demand hours based on weekday calculations
- **Filtering Compatibility:** Enhanced calculations work with all existing filtering features
- **Export Functionality:** CSV and JSON exports include accurate weekday-based calculations

### Performance Considerations

- **Monitoring Integration:** Performance metrics track calculation times
- **Caching Support:** Results can be cached for improved performance
- **Batch Processing:** Handles large datasets efficiently

## Testing and Validation

### Test Coverage

1. **Unit Tests:** Individual component testing with various weekday configurations
2. **Integration Tests:** End-to-end testing with matrix visualization
3. **Performance Tests:** Large dataset processing validation
4. **Regression Tests:** Ensures no impact on other recurrence types

### Validation Criteria

- Weekly tasks with weekdays show accurate increased demand
- Legacy weekly tasks maintain existing calculation results
- All other recurrence types remain unaffected
- Matrix visualization displays correct totals
- Export functionality includes enhanced calculations

## Maintenance Guidelines

### Code Documentation Standards

1. **Method-Level Documentation:** Each method includes purpose, parameters, and return value descriptions
2. **Calculation Examples:** Inline comments provide calculation examples for reference
3. **Error Scenarios:** Documentation covers error handling and fallback behaviors
4. **Integration Notes:** Comments explain how components interact

### Monitoring and Debugging

1. **Comprehensive Logging:** Detailed logs for calculation steps and validation results
2. **Performance Metrics:** Tracking of calculation times and resource usage
3. **Error Reporting:** Clear error messages with context for troubleshooting
