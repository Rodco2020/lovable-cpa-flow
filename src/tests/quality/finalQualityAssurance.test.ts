/**
 * Final Quality Assurance Test Suite
 * 
 * This is the main entry point for comprehensive quality assurance testing.
 * All individual test modules are imported and executed from here to ensure
 * the application meets all quality standards before deployment.
 * 
 * Test Categories:
 * - Critical User Workflows: Core functionality testing
 * - Performance Standards: Loading time and performance requirements
 * - Accessibility Standards: WCAG compliance and usability
 * - Error Handling: Graceful error recovery
 * - Data Integrity: State consistency and data flow
 * - Security Standards: Protection against common vulnerabilities
 * - Cross-Browser Compatibility: Browser support validation
 * - Responsive Design: Multi-device compatibility
 * - Integration Points: Inter-component communication
 * - Memory Management: Resource cleanup and leak prevention
 * - Bundle Size Optimization: Code efficiency
 * - API Integration: External service communication
 * - User Experience Standards: UI/UX quality
 * - Content Standards: Content structure and presentation
 * - Deployment Readiness: Production deployment validation

/**
 * This file serves as the orchestrator for all quality assurance tests.
 * By importing all test modules, Jest will automatically discover and run
 * all tests when this file is executed.
 * 
 * Benefits of this approach:
 * 1. Modular test organization
 * 2. Easy maintenance and updates
 * 3. Clear separation of concerns
 * 4. Improved readability and navigation
 * 5. Simplified debugging and troubleshooting
