/**
 * Staff ID Normalization Utilities - Backward Compatibility Export
 * 
 * This file maintains backward compatibility by re-exporting the refactored utilities.
 * All existing functionality is preserved with no changes to the public API.
 * 
 * The implementation has been moved to a modular structure under the
 * staffIdUtils directory for improved maintainability:
 * 
 * - core.ts: Core normalization and comparison functions
 * - validation.ts: Array validation and analysis utilities
 * - matching.ts: Staff ID matching and search utilities  
 * - testing.ts: Comprehensive testing and validation functions
 * 
 * All modules work together to provide the same functionality as the original
 * 238-line implementation, but with better separation of concerns and testability.
 * 
 * PHASE 3 enhancements include comprehensive validation, testing utilities,
 * and enhanced comparison functions for robust staff ID operations.
