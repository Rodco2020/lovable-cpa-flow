# Matrix Core Services

This directory contains the refactored core services for matrix generation, organized for better maintainability and separation of concerns.

## Architecture

### SkillNormalizationHandler
- **Purpose**: Handles skill normalization for demand matrices
- **Key Method**: `normalizeDemandMatrixSkills()`
- **Responsibility**: Ensures consistent skill mapping between demand and capacity matrices

### MatrixDataProcessor
- **Purpose**: Transforms demand matrix and capacity forecast into unified matrix data
- **Key Method**: `skillConsistentTransformDemandToMatrix()`
- **Responsibility**: Creates the final matrix data structure with proper skill alignment

### MatrixGenerationOrchestrator
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates the complete matrix generation process
- **Key Method**: `generateFreshMatrixDataWithFixedSkillMapping()`
- **Responsibility**: Coordinates all steps of matrix generation including validation

## Refactoring Benefits

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each class has a single, well-defined responsibility
2. **Improved Testability**: Smaller, focused methods are easier to unit test
3. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to specific functionality are isolated
4. **Enhanced Readability**: Code is organized logically and easier to follow
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Large methods have been broken into manageable pieces

## Functionality Preservation

All existing functionality has been preserved exactly as it was. The refactoring:
- ✅ Maintains identical input/output behavior
- ✅ Preserves all error handling
- ✅ Keeps the same caching behavior
- ✅ Maintains logging and debugging features
- ✅ Preserves validation logic

## Testing

The refactored code maintains compatibility with all existing tests. New focused unit tests can be added for individual components.
