/**
 * Enhanced Preferred Staff Filter Strategy - Main Export
 * 
 * This is the main export file for the comprehensively enhanced preferred staff filter strategy.
 * The strategy has been enhanced with surgical precision debugging and comprehensive validation
 * to address the core field mapping issue that was preventing proper preferred staff filtering.
 * 
 * ENHANCEMENT MODULES:
 * - types.ts: Enhanced type definitions with comprehensive debugging interfaces
 * - validationUtils.ts: Enhanced input validation and data analysis
 * - dataPointProcessor.ts: Enhanced core filtering logic with surgical precision debugging
 * - diagnosticsUtils.ts: Comprehensive diagnostic and troubleshooting utilities
 * - testingUtils.ts: End-to-end testing and validation capabilities
 * - preferredStaffFilterStrategy.ts: Main enhanced strategy implementation
 * 
 * KEY FIXES IMPLEMENTED:
 * - Surgical precision field mapping validation (snake_case to camelCase)
 * - Comprehensive debugging at every step of the filtering process
 * - Enhanced error detection and reporting
 * - End-to-end testing capabilities
 * - Zero results diagnostic system
 * 
 * All existing functionality is preserved with no changes to the public API,
 * but with dramatically enhanced debugging and validation capabilities.
